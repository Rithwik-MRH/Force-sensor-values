# Force-sensor-values
This code will display the ADC values from a force/load sensor on LCD board

INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED FOR THE PROJECT:
1. arduino board
2. force/load sensor
3. jumper wires
4. lcd board (16*2 lcd board is used here)
5. bread board

Procedure:
The arduino board is pluged in after the circuit connections are made
Then the code is uploaded in to the board trough the arduino IDE software ( Make sure that the liquid crystal library is downloaded in the software)
The serial monitor and the lcd board will display the values
